Understanding CORS - Pivotal Spring Article. Accessing the Flask based API with Postman works, using Curl works, but it fails when connecting with your web application. (It worked just fine locally using the webpack proxy.) Checking the console shows an Access-Control-Allow-Origin error. Welcome to CORS or how to convince the browser to trust your API server. One option with Flask is to use Flask-CORS . It works fine until you decide to setup authorisation with your Amazon API Gateway. Now the browser complains that Access-Control-Allow-Origin cannot be set to \"*\". Since this API will be accessed by multiple web applications with different domain names, having one location configured does not work. Fastest solution for me was to configure the response headers directly with Flask. Just use the @app.after_request decorator and the global request object. @app.after_request runs after every request, even if you're using Blueprints. Because request is a global object, the request headers are available in the decorator function. This includes the Origin header which points to the web application server. Create a function with the @app.after_request decorator. In the function, include a list of allowed domains to verify the web servers allowed to access the API. If allowed, that server is set as the Origin in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. The response headers now has a specific Origin returned. Unfortunately, using Amazon's API Gateway to authorize client access removes the Origin header. To fix, include a check for the Host header if the Origin header is not available. Code is below.

Understanding CORS - Pivotal Spring Article. Accessing the Flask based API with Postman works, using Curl works, but it fails when connecting with your web application. (It worked just fine locally using the webpack proxy.) Checking the console shows an Access-Control-Allow-Origin error. Welcome to CORS or how to convince the browser to trust your API server. One option with Flask is to use Flask-CORS . It works fine until you decide to setup authorisation with your Amazon API Gateway. Now the browser complains that Access-Control-Allow-Origin cannot be set to \"*\". Since this API will be accessed by multiple web applications with different domain names, having one location configured does not work. Fastest solution for me was to configure the response headers directly with Flask. Just use the @app.after_request decorator and the global request object. @app.after_request runs after every request, even if you're using Blueprints. Because request is a global object, the request headers are available in the decorator function. This includes the Origin header which points to the web application server. Create a function with the @app.after_request decorator. In the function, include a list of allowed domains to verify the web servers allowed to access the API. If allowed, that server is set as the Origin in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. The response headers now has a specific Origin returned.

Resolve issue with vue' is not a module - did it before but didn't take notes. typescript building error when import .vue file with separate .ts file . // @ts-ignore import HelloWorld from '@/components/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.vue'; Makes the error go away. Still having issues with CORS on API Gateway. Want to configure it to allow from any .lookfindme.com domain. But there seems to be an issue with creating new resources. It just spins. Might have to close my browser and reopen. On the plus side, computer is working much better today. Seems that using terminals in Visual Studio Code is just asking for trouble. Error: \"'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '\". Seems to be a combination of Chrome browser and server. Trying to enable CORS on the API gateway and see if that helps. Resolved: * Added header to nginx* config. location /admin { add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*'; include /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params; uwsgi_pass flask; uwsgi_param Host $host; uwsgi_param X-Real-IP $remote_addr; uwsgi_param X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; uwsgi_param X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto; } Going to try and add it to the server level. Below does not work add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*'; location / { # First attempt to serve request as file, then # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404. try_files $uri $uri/ =404; } Restart nginx on Ubuntu - sudo systemctl restart nginx.service To get this work. Have to configure nginx with add_header* to allow 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' to work. Configuring the API gateway doesn't matter. https://vpc-lookfindme-oxhmtdgaa63hkgxaxtmivoqkhm.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/ - Elastic Search URL Add Ability to create and edit membership to admin site. Have membership_level enum - membership_level Adding foreign_key constraint. Want roles to come from role table. Creating Flyway Migration using sql below. Seems that it is easier to drop a column rather than trying to change it to UUID. ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.memberships DROP COLUMN member_role; ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.memberships ADD COLUMN role_uuid UUID REFERENCES role (uuid); ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.memberships RENAME TO membership; Just being anal about renaming member_level to level. Current time: 00:10 Creating a test for my membership service. Add new membership Find a new membership Update a current membership Can't delete a membership because it may not be available but a user might still be on it. Had to fix and issue with migrations. Can't use level as a field name. Changed the migration. Fix flyway - gradle flywayRepair - fix issues with migration. Working with raw json in python - Pyton Json json_string = \"\"\" { \"researcher\": { \"name\": \"Ford Prefect\", \"species\": \"Betelgeusian\", \"relatives\": [ { \"name\": \"Zaphod Beeblebrox\", \"species\": \"Betelgeusian\" } ] } } \"\"\" Apparently Flask does deserialise the json data when you use request.get_json() Completed adding memberships to code. Added Schemas and code to add, retrieve memberships. Need to add code to update memberships. Don't think we have code to update records. Completed adding the filters too. Testing as you go along makes it easier to insure everything is working. Plus, helps with content switching. Thursday 14 June 2018 Spent all morning updating the work machine. It downloaded the latest updates. Removed Chrome from my startup items. Don't know how it got there. Also removed some cruft left over from a Samsung install. Concerned that my iPad is about to die. Really like using YouTube for playing music from the iMac. Also, seems that the issue with Visual Studio Code was trying to use terminal in it. Today's Goal lookfindme Publish admin site and connect to demo site. [x] Able to update membership and it shows on demo site. Add about and it shows on demo site. Terms and Privacy updated on demo site. Change industry titles and it shows on demo site. Change front and industry image. Why is_enabled, is_test and is_published? is_enabled = shows up on the public site is_test = does not show up on the public site. Used when running tests. Want to be able to run tests on live site. is_published = once it has been made available to the general public, it cannot be deleted anymore. is_published and is_enabled has to be both activated for it to show on the public site. Tasks [x] Add is_test column to all tables. Can then checked if record was generated by tests. Memberships [x] Update memberships - send post request to membership/id [x] is_published flag. Once published, cannot be deleted. Industries [x] Add new industry [x] Update title and image of current industry [x] Can disable but not delete. [x] Add is enabled flagged [x] Add is_published flagged. Connect cognito to AWS API Gateway Able to use AWS library when posting to API vs using local library when working locally. [x] Update marshmallow on local machine. Spend an hour working on trying to connect spring to a database and making an API call with it. Not going to happen today Commands in Term2 shell that I should memorise since I use them all the time. Command D - split horizontally Shift Command D - split vertically Upgrading stuff. We will see how this goes. sdk - upgrade java related tools. nvm - upgrade node to 10.4.1 and reinstall packages lookfindme - upgraded packages. Still can't upgrade rxjs and @types/node because of issues with vue. Have to stick to rxjs@6.2.0 and @types/node@10.2.1 Updated IntelliJ from drop-down tool. Trying to upgrade my marshmallow package. First removing marshmallow-sqlalchemy. Didn't use it. Seems that pipenv requires me to remove marshmallow first and then reinstall it. Also removing some other packages. pipenv uninstall jsonschema psycopg2 gunicorn blinker marshmallow Had to create an update service in my services class because it didn't have one before. Keep getting errors about psycopg2 requiring the binary driver. Uninstalled the psycopg2 module and just left the psycopg2-binary module. Now not being found by the database server string. Reinstalled psycopg2 and that seems to work. Will have to figure out why the psycopg2-binary isn't working but not going to deal with it right now. Seems to have some issues around marshmallow update. Updated marshmallow does not require the .data attribute when I serialise to json. Had to remove that. Updating data Current config returns the total number of records processed rather than the updated record. Want to returning feature of the call. Note to self. See if you can find the tests for a module to find out how to use the module. Will have to investigate further later. Taking too much time just trying to get it to work. Commit with test data related to update_args Going to try and get rid of psycopg2 error that is bugging me. Uninstalling the psycopg2 package. Going to install pipenv install --no-binary :all: psycopg2 We will see how well it works. Fix Psycopg2 Warning export PIP_NO_BINARY=psycopg2 pipenv install psycopg2 Error message is gone now. Create industries setup and tests. Add new industry Update an industry Get one industry Get list of industries Test created and now testing the test. Tests pass. Now moving on to the front-end. AWS Amplify and API Gateway. Get API Gateway settings REST vs PUT - PUT is suppose to be idempotent so probably better for updates. Restful API Tutorial Testing the API Gateway with an Auth Token. Setting up authorisation for API Gateway User Pool is already setup via Mobile Hub. Open API Gateway Console. Select Authorizers Create new Authorizer Select Cognitor as the provider Select the UserPool from the list when you click in the field box. Token Source is Authorization Save. Test your provider I'm already using aws amplify for site authentication Grabbed the JWT token from the JavaScript Console Copy and paste only the token (no quotes) into the test box. Click test and see if your authorisation works. Deploy to your API First add authorization to your resource. Deploy your API Can test with Postman by providing JWT token. Using ngrok to try and use it to access API Gateway Issue with invalid header. Solution: Invalid Host Header when ngrok tries to connect to React dev server ngrok http 8080 -host-header=\"localhost:8080\" ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 8080 Getting ngrok going ngrok http 8080 -host-header=\"localhost:8080\" Back to working on front-end Get industries from backend Create model of industry Backend service to get industries * Refactor to create one get request. Getting Roles and enums too. For downloads. Have tests working on server. Now working on front-end side. Still not done. Adding new add forms. Friday 15 June 2018 Seems like a lot of time working on getting the backend services to work. Machine was updated and updated local software. Going to resist the desire to update the software again today. I actually need to try and get some stuff done. Did kinda figure out how setup an AWS API Gateway with authentication and how to test it. Definitely need to write up these notes as blog posts. Need to take Hennely's talk to heart about estimating. I'm way off when it comes to estimating the time it will take. Have to post sites today. Also want to create an RSS feed for my blog. RSS feed is already available on the Wordpress site. Just need to figure out how to forward RSS requests at https://www.johan-martin.com/rss to https://api.paseo.org.za/johan/rss. If using Apache, I would jus t proxy it. Don't know if we can do that with Google Firebase. Might have to create a custom function. URL Redirects - Might have to use that in the short-term. Will look later.

Part 1 of a series. Working on the membership form. Get a list of memberships. Popup window to view and edit it. Vuetify notes v-container - page level v-layout - section or component level v-flex - specific item. sets flex on this level. inside component should just us v-flex [] Create membership list item component. Going to show it as a v-card. Need to look at content for membership in google site. * Have to include // @ts-ignore in front of all import statements to keep vue from freaking out. * Created the ListItem. Now need to get it to show the Item correctly. Will do that when I come back from my run. * Removed separate List component. Just creating a separate ListItem to format individual list items. * Creating a new membershipModel that includes a meta object. Object contains uuid and the action taken. Idea is that when an action happens in the listItem, I can update the membershipModel and get those results. We will see if that works. Don't think it's going to work because I'm no longer doing a separate list component. Now, List is actually the main component and all actions should just bubble up to the Membership component. Actions will be. Edit, Enable, and delete if not published. * Adding additional parameters to the membership. jobseekers - how many you can interact with and industries is how many you can search across. * Basic card created. Also realize that one cannot edit a membership that has already been published. Would cause too much confusion. So, once it is created and published, it can no longer be edited. * Trying to get form out of dialog that is holding a form. Random notes. Hate it when I lost a thought that I just had and wanted to write down. Really annoying!!!! Going to run at 13:57. Got back at 15:19 Creating a prettier - .prettierrc configuration file. Hope I can get it to work with Vue files. Pre-commit hooks for node/npm Husky - can configure package.json file with precommit hooks. Pre-commit hooks - manage and maintain precommit hooks. Installed npm install eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier --save-dev Configuration: editor.formatOnSave Prettier VSCode Plugin Typescript array - string[] or Array Associate template.html files as vue-html files for syntax highlighting to work again. Computer is running really slow. Have to restart to see if it gets any better. Don't know why it's going so slow. After quitting out of Visual Studio Code, everything seems better. Only change I've made was to the prettier config. Haven't changed anything else. Also, did change html config to jsbeauty or something similar. Might be related to that. But does seem that visual studio code gets bogged down sometimes. My version node seems to keep crashing with Vue. Downgraded to 10.1.0 that I had before. Will see if it still crashes as much. echo \"10.1.0\" > .nvmrc in my current project folder. nvm alias default v10.1.0 to get back to previous version. Going to attempt to upgrade my copy of nvm to latest tagged version. Getting really frustrated with constantly having to go back to the documentation. Ok. Had to restart IA writer. Seems to be working better now. Don't know why this machine randomly starts slowing down. <component :component=\"passedin\" /> - Figure out which value is which. Well, seems that it is still crashing even though I've downgraded my NPM. Restarting and upgrading. See if that makes any difference. Think my setup might just be bad news. Restarting everything and see what works. Reinstall rxjs@6.2.0 and @types/node@10.1.2. Just uninstalling rxjs wasn't enough. Still getting errors. Won't be able to build the project with those errors. Getting stuck on formatting the site. Really need to up my CSS skills. It takes me way too much time to format anything. Still trying to at least style the form to look like someting interesting. Finally working on the form. Got the basics done. Now trying to figure out how to take an array and make it into an editable area while allowing for additional items to be added. Reduced the number of items being pulled into my form. Seems to have eliminated some of the issues with my node crashing.

Membership form status [ ] - Form in own component [ ] - In dialog box [ ] - model tied to form [ ] - Able to change data [ ] - Array to add new benefit items. Huge fan of prettier. On save is too resource intensive. Works fine to just do it when saving the data. Going to attempt to enable eslint feature. Making the detail item into its own component. Anything that takes more than a couple lines of code needs to be its own component. Trying to get a filter to work. Idea is that we will format the number as a regular number but it is actually stored as a integer. Also realising, because the v-module is reactive, we need to make a copy of it and update the copy. Else, we update our actual data and it is an issue when you hit the reset butt. Working on the filter now. Vue does have a filter option. Trying to figure out how to use the filter option in a vue component class. Handling form submission in Vue <form @submit.prevent=\"handleSubmit\"></form> handleSubmit() {} Using functional components for very basic presentation. Vue Functional Components - Render functional components Using filters with vue component class @Component({ filters: { trim() { /* some code here */ } } }) class YourComponent extends Vue { } Have a form that I need to use to update local information. Form gets its values passed to it when I click on the edit button. Want to leave the original values alone and only mess with the copied values. Watch the imported property Assign the oldval of the property to the form model. This means the model now points to the local variable. Update the data and submit that data. Problem now is to deep copy/clone the object so everything is disconnected. Might have to install lodash. Tried with an observable. Still getting the full copy. Need to figure out how to clone an object in JavaScript. Clone a JavaScript object. Just wants to make sure that the original is not impacted by any changes I make. JSON.parse(JSON.stringify( obj )); Although the above method works, it feels like a hack. Decided to install lodash and use it's cloneDeep method CloneDeep . Now have to save the data back to the database. Show the price divided by 100. Do it when we clone the record. Using loads to pick only the values I want to save. Complete record is not necessary. this.membership is the object with the updated data. Unfortunately, it also has all the data retrieved from the server including created and updated fields that are not required here. Local model is the new Membership() . Grab the keys from it and use that to only grab the properties I need for saving into the database. Huge fan of lodash. const formData = _.pick(this.membership, _.keys(new Membership())); Huge fan of using models to manage my objects. Have to only update the model and everything else is updated everywhere else. Big time saver for getting work done. Had to add and remove properties from an object. Because I have a model for it, it's as simple as editing the model. Just created a blog post for my blog about lodash. Going to setup medium next week. Just started using the AWS Amplify Logger utility again. Great way to implement logging and not have it show up on the live site. const logger = new Logger('name'); . Actually using it. logger.debug('what I need to log'); . Logger Guide) Trying to save data to the server. Need to remove the uuid key. Seems like the update is failing if the uuid key is one of the fields included. Of course, working on a slow machine. Really need to get this done so I can apply for real work. This is killing me but I promised. Ok. Got the delete with permission to work. Getting the enabled setup now. Going to try and finish the industries too. Only requirement there is that you can add a new industry and edit maybe the image. Everything else stays static. Got enable and disable to work. Need to put logic for is_published on server side rather than just on the client side. Added logic on server side. Switching between JavaScript and Python can be confusing. Going to spend a little time working on the layout of the Membership item and then we will tackle the industries. I really hate computers. Issue with wloudinary not working. max_results=100 - has to be an integer. Initially was a string. Huge fan of Jupiter notebooks for python development. Able to walk through API calls to wloudinary by importing it into the notebook. Could figure out what I was doing wrong. Python list/filter/map - map_filter_reduce , List comprehension Filtering all the images with 'STATIC' in their title. Used Jupyter notebook to run the below tasks from app.common.Utils import cloudinary resource = cloudinary.api.resources(max_results=100) result = list(filter(lambda x: 'STATIC' in x['public_id'], resource['resources'])) Adding images definitely changes how I do this. Got most of the images to work and got localStorage to work. Check to see if I have the images stored in local storage, if not, retrieve from server. This will let me limit the number of calls to the server and keep me from running over my allocation. We'll see how well this works. Sunday 16 June 2018 Relatively successful day yesterday. Got the forms to work the way I wanted. Got localstorage working for the images. Was able to do that and still return an observable of images. Really overkill at this juncture but trying to play with the big kids. It does seem that everything should be a behaviourSubject in rxjs land. Can definitely see that once you have some idea of how to build something, doing it the second time around is much, much faster. Created the industry layout in minutes rather than hours trying to figure out how to get it to work. Got the basics working. Will tie it all together when I get back. Excited to work on something when you have some idea what you are doing. Just got back from Leandra's place for lunch. Nice to hang out with cousin and talk about random stuff. Need to finish up these two projects so I can start working on social network sites. Definitely want to work on SABBN site. Now also have the black shopping site with the South African domain name. Might want to see how we can collaborate with the guy in the US. We will see. Need to get my digital design company out there too. This is going to happen. Working on the industry form. Want to be able to save the state of the industry when it gets published. Don't think it matters since the positions get transferred to the user anyway. So, make each position so you can edit it(?). Might have to put something on the end-user computer to let them know if a position has been retired(?). We have the industry. That is an uuid, so it's not an issue. Decided to add a cloudinary_image option. That will need to be the image we use going forward. Update the current setup to use that image. Refer to current image as image filter tag. Python note: to get a list back when filtering the images return list(filter(lambda x: industry_image_title in x['public_id'], images)) Just spent over 2 hours trying to resolve an issue with v-select. How to get an object to show up as the value of the select. Solution was to have the text-value also present while returning the whole object. I hate computers and components when you're not sure how it works. <v-select v-model=\"industry.cloudinary_image\" label=\"Industry Image\" hint=\"Industry Image\" item-text=\"public_id\" item-value=\"public_id\" :items=\"IndustryImages\" return-object ></v-select>","title":"11 June 2018"},{"location":"journal/DevJourn_11_june_2018/#developer-journal-week-of-11-june-2018","text":"My Developer Notebook is at Developer Notebook Brain dump of notes I'm making while working on projects.

Terms and Privacy updated on demo site. Change industry titles and it shows on demo site. Change front and industry image. Why is_enabled, is_test and is_published? is_enabled = shows up on the public site is_test = does not show up on the public site. Used when running tests. Want to be able to run tests on live site. is_published = once it has been made available to the general public, it cannot be deleted anymore. is_published and is_enabled has to be both activated for it to show on the public site. Tasks [x] Add is_test column to all tables. Can then checked if record was generated by tests. Memberships [x] Update memberships - send post request to membership/id [x] is_published flag. Once published, cannot be deleted. Industries [x] Add new industry [x] Update title and image of current industry [x] Can disable but not delete. [x] Add is enabled flagged [x] Add is_published flagged. Connect cognito to AWS API Gateway Able to use AWS library when posting to API vs using local library when working locally. [x] Update marshmallow on local machine. Spend an hour working on trying to connect spring to a database and making an API call with it. Not going to happen today Commands in Term2 shell that I should memorise since I use them all the time. Command D - split horizontally Shift Command D - split vertically Upgrading stuff. We will see how this goes. sdk - upgrade java related tools. nvm - upgrade node to 10.4.1 and reinstall packages lookfindme - upgraded packages. Still can't upgrade rxjs and @types/node because of issues with vue. Have to stick to rxjs@6.2.0 and @types/node@10.2.1 Updated IntelliJ from drop-down tool. Trying to upgrade my marshmallow package. First removing marshmallow-sqlalchemy. Didn't use it. Seems that pipenv requires me to remove marshmallow first and then reinstall it. Also removing some other packages. pipenv uninstall jsonschema psycopg2 gunicorn blinker marshmallow Had to create an update service in my services class because it didn't have one before. Keep getting errors about psycopg2 requiring the binary driver. Uninstalled the psycopg2 module and just left the psycopg2-binary module. Now not being found by the database server string. Reinstalled psycopg2 and that seems to work. Will have to figure out why the psycopg2-binary isn't working but not going to deal with it right now. Seems to have some issues around marshmallow update. Updated marshmallow does not require the .data attribute when I serialise to json. Had to remove that. Updating data Current config returns the total number of records processed rather than the updated record. Want to returning feature of the call. Note to self. See if you can find the tests for a module to find out how to use the module. Will have to investigate further later. Taking too much time just trying to get it to work. Commit with test data related to update_args Going to try and get rid of psycopg2 error that is bugging me. Uninstalling the psycopg2 package.

On save is too resource intensive. Works fine to just do it when saving the data. Going to attempt to enable eslint feature. Making the detail item into its own component. Anything that takes more than a couple lines of code needs to be its own component. Trying to get a filter to work. Idea is that we will format the number as a regular number but it is actually stored as a integer. Also realising, because the v-module is reactive, we need to make a copy of it and update the copy. Else, we update our actual data and it is an issue when you hit the reset butt. Working on the filter now. Vue does have a filter option. Trying to figure out how to use the filter option in a vue component class. Handling form submission in Vue <form @submit.prevent=\"handleSubmit\"></form> handleSubmit() {} Using functional components for very basic presentation. Vue Functional Components - Render functional components Using filters with vue component class @Component({ filters: { trim() { /* some code here */ } } }) class YourComponent extends Vue { } Have a form that I need to use to update local information. Form gets its values passed to it when I click on the edit button. Want to leave the original values alone and only mess with the copied values. Watch the imported property Assign the oldval of the property to the form model. This means the model now points to the local variable. Update the data and submit that data. Problem now is to deep copy/clone the object so everything is disconnected. Might have to install lodash. Tried with an observable. Still getting the full copy. Need to figure out how to clone an object in JavaScript. Clone a JavaScript object. Just wants to make sure that the original is not impacted by any changes I make. JSON.parse(JSON.stringify( obj )); Although the above method works, it feels like a hack. Decided to install lodash and use it's cloneDeep method CloneDeep . Now have to save the data back to the database. Show the price divided by 100. Do it when we clone the record. Using loads to pick only the values I want to save. Complete record is not necessary. this.membership is the object with the updated data. Unfortunately, it also has all the data retrieved from the server including created and updated fields that are not required here. Local model is the new Membership() . Grab the keys from it and use that to only grab the properties I need for saving into the database. Huge fan of lodash. const formData = _.pick(this.membership, _.keys(new Membership())); Huge fan of using models to manage my objects. Have to only update the model and everything else is updated everywhere else. Big time saver for getting work done. Had to add and remove properties from an object. Because I have a model for it, it's as simple as editing the model. Just created a blog post for my blog about lodash. Going to setup medium next week. Just started using the AWS Amplify Logger utility again. Great way to implement logging and not have it show up on the live site. const logger = new Logger('name'); . Actually using it. logger.debug('what I need to log'); . Logger Guide) Trying to save data to the server. Need to remove the uuid key. Seems like the update is failing if the uuid key is one of the fields included. Of course, working on a slow machine. Really need to get this done so I can apply for real work. This is killing me but I promised. Ok. Got the delete with permission to work. Getting the enabled setup now. Going to try and finish the industries too. Only requirement there is that you can add a new industry and edit maybe the image. Everything else stays static. Got enable and disable to work. Need to put logic for is_published on server side rather than just on the client side. Added logic on server side. Switching between JavaScript and Python can be confusing. Going to spend a little time working on the layout of the Membership item and then we will tackle the industries. I really hate computers. Issue with wloudinary not working. max_results=100 - has to be an integer. Initially was a string. Huge fan of Jupiter notebooks for python development. Able to walk through API calls to wloudinary by importing it into the notebook. Could figure out what I was doing wrong. Python list/filter/map - map_filter_reduce , List comprehension Filtering all the images with 'STATIC' in their title. Used Jupyter notebook to run the below tasks from app.common.Utils import cloudinary resource = cloudinary.api.resources(max_results=100) result = list(filter(lambda x: 'STATIC' in x['public_id'], resource['resources'])) Adding images definitely changes how I do this. Got most of the images to work and got localStorage to work. Check to see if I have the images stored in local storage, if not, retrieve from server. This will let me limit the number of calls to the server and keep me from running over my allocation.

Want to be able to save the state of the industry when it gets published. Don't think it matters since the positions get transferred to the user anyway. So, make each position so you can edit it(?). Might have to put something on the end-user computer to let them know if a position has been retired(?). We have the industry. That is an uuid, so it's not an issue. Decided to add a cloudinary_image option. That will need to be the image we use going forward. Update the current setup to use that image. Refer to current image as image filter tag.

So close but for the details. Monday, 18 June 2018 Still working on lookfindme admin site. Having issues with the industries list. Not updating if there is only one item in the json array. Don't know why that it is. It will save okay but it seems to have an issue updating. Will check the interwebs else might just convert it to an array or a string with pipe characters and store it as a string. The data is actually being sent. The issue is the it is not being saved. * Using integers for all my money. Listened to a webcast about using integers for currency rather than floats. Requires a little more on the front-end side but then, I'm trying to avoid anything on the front-end that will have to be redone on the backend anyway. lookfindme Look into why the industries list of positions doesn't want to update if there is only 1 item in the list. Resolved by adding synchronize_session='evaluate' - result = self.query.filter(self._table.uuid == uuid).update(update_values, synchronize_session='evaluate') Query Details Now have to work on the enable/disable issues. Fix the issue with the database not respecting UUIDs passed in from the API. Only seems to be an issue when I'm not passing it in as a primary key. No problem if it is a primary key. SQLAlchemy Schema Table - Postgresql.UUID database/engine.py class SiteSettings(base): __table__ = Table( c.TABLE_SITE, meta, Column('site_uuid', postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=True)), autoload=True, autoload_with=engine, extend_existing=True ) routes/admin.py @bp.route('/site/<uuid:site_id>', methods=['GET']) def site_get(site_id): try: result = SiteServiceModel.get_json_data(site_id) except SQLAlchemyError as err: response = SiteServiceModel.get_response_error(err) else: response = SiteServiceModel.get_response_result(result) return response It is elif in python. Remove dictionary key - record_data.pop('uuid', None) Does not raise an error but returns None as default. Had to update my tests. Apparently, unless you spell out the complete test, it is not being run. But the tests are at least running now. Finally got the industry list to work correctly. Now can update and enable them. On the industry, we allow editing an industry if it is not enabled. Once enabled, it can't be edited. Don't really check for that in the backend. Should put in a check for that. But I'm done with the industry list for now. Going to work on the settings part. Trying to make the settings part into tabs. Seems like a better idea than the drop down. Also need to change what we are storing in the settings object. Don't think we need images anymore. Another question is, do we break things up into their own columns? Since we are saving the complete record every time, don't think we need to. Tabs look okay. Not going to win any awards for the layout or design. Need to see which css framework will work okay with vuetify. Adding a new item to the top of a JavaScript array - unshift . Assume it plays hell on the memory but it looks better. Updated create scripts for database. Now need to work on authentication and security to make sure that works okay. Going to work on authguard and aws amplify again. What do I need to notify when things change? Going to attempt to get the current session and get the necessary token to auth with our api gateway service.

Tuesday 19 June 2018 I'm the hell knowns as CORS. Trying to access the backend application but have to configure CORS to allow access. Getting a list of known/required headers is a nightmare. Plus, API Gateway CORS support should only be enabled after you get CORS working with your application. It's a freaking nightmare. I did this once when I built the Wordpress plugin. Will see if I have any notes related to that. Wordpress Header Notes - Notes related to me working on a PHP wordpress project related to headers. Creating a decorator in python Python Decorators - Primer on Python Decorators Using jupyter notebook to walk through it. Actually created a separate notebook. Think I have the hang of it. def add_headers(response_function): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): headers = response_function(*args, **kwargs) headers['extra'] = '1' print(headers) # return response_function(*args, **kwargs) return headers return wrapper @add_headers def response_function(): result = {'hello': 'World'} return result # demo_function = add_headers(response_function) # print(demo_function()) print(response_function()) My Code @add_headers def get_response_result(result, code=200): response = make_response(jsonify({'result': result}), code) return response def get_response_error(result=\"An error occurred\", code=400): response = make_response(jsonify({'error': str(result)}), code) return response def add_headers(response_function): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): response = response_function(*args, **kwargs) response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Authorization, Content-Type' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'] = True return response return wrapper In Python, function order matters. Can't call a function before it is defined. So, CORS functionality actually takes the response from the request and returns the origin based on that request. Mmmm. Look into logging when I get back. How to resolve this CORS issue? Client is sending headers to the server which the server needs to respond to. It's and OPTION call which means we need to reply to that call. Don't know if the ajax observable is sending things I don't know about. Need to setup logging for Python so I can log what is happening. Fixing the issue [x] Setup logging for Python * Can at least tell which functions are being called. * Going with flask_cors. Still having issues. Can't seem to be able to save anything. Used to work via a proxy. [x] See what is being sent in the headers when the client connects to the server. Using curl -i -X OPTIONS [x] See what we are sending back. [x] Decorator is not working because I'm sending back a result rather than a function that produces a result. curl to find out if we are getting the right headers back. curl -i -X OPTIONS include header information Sending Post Data via curl curl --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --request POST \\ --data '{\"username\":\"xyz\",\"password\":\"xyz\"}' \\ http://localhost:3000/api/login * Shows what header information is being returned. * Need to get a generic setup to return for any option request. * Fixed an issue where the loader wasn't going away during an error.

Was fighting with the client and the backend server. Seems that everything is related to the FLASK/python application sending the correct headers back to the web client. Ended up using flask-cors. Seems like it already does all the dirty work I need to do. When one is doing functions, one has to keep that in mind. [x] Getting import roles to work [x] Get the all setup to work too. Issue I'm running into now. 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '*' . See if I can get ngrok to work. Who knows. On Amazon API Gateway. Enabled CORS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: true OPTIONS there too. On the client withCredentials: true Added Authorization Header Leaving crossDomain as false Creating a new API from scratch. I'm worried that the CORS stuff is all messed up. Hardest part is getting the domain redirected to the new domain name. Nothing is ever just straightforward. Think the issue I'm having right now is that the backend server is returning \"*\" in the content header. These headers are a mess. So, when you delete your API and you also deleted the custom domain, it seems that the only way to create a new one with the same domain name is to remove that domain from your dns and then recreate. Ok. Deleted the cname record from GoDaddy and was able to recreate the custom domain name. Now just have to wait for it to initialise. That takes forever. In the meantime, going to set the url to ngrok to see if we can get that to work. Might need to have some type of webhook to determine which origin header to use. Configuring flask-cors to only allow from a specific domain name. - Flask CORS Documentation - Might have to not use this anymore. Seems like I may have found a solution that works better. We will see. CORS(app, expose_headers='Authorization', origins=['*.lookfindme.com', '*.ngrok.io'], supports_credentials=True) Side note - added PIP_NO_BINARY=psycopg2 to .flaskenv file. Hoping that will stick so pipenv doesn't install the wrong version of psycopg2 that keeps sending out an error message. ngrok config - Documentation Creating an ngrok.yml file in the api folder. Run both services via ngrok in the eu region. Start command - ngrok start -config=./ngrok.yml --all region: eu tunnels: api: proto: http addr: 5000 bind_tls: true admin: proto: http addr: 8080 host_header: \"localhost:8080\" bind_tls: true Think we finally resolve the CORS issue. Ended up with using a flask after configuration to get everything going the way we want. Need to put the code here. Restarted visual studio code because it was running really slow. Added the code below to my create_app() function for creating flask app @app.after_request def after_request(response): response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', \"https://2a9cc487.eu.ngrok.io\") response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With') response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true') response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE') return response list of headers to configure $origin=isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'])?$_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']:$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']; header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '.$origin); header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS, GET, PUT'); header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true'); header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, X-Requested-With'); header('P3P: CP=\"NON DSP LAW CUR ADM DEV TAI PSA PSD HIS OUR DEL IND UNI PUR COM NAV INT DEM CNT STA POL HEA PRE LOC IVD SAM IVA OTC\"'); header('Access-Control-Max-Age: 1'); We finally have a solution that includes dynamically adding a CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. \"\"\"Main Flask App\"\"\" from flask import Flask, request from app.config.settings import config ALLOWED_URLS = config('ALLOWED_URLS').split(\"|\") def create_app(): app = Flask(__name__) import app.routes.test as test_route import app.routes.admin as admin_route import app.routes.site as site_route import app.routes.user as user_route app.register_blueprint(test_route.bp) app.register_blueprint(admin_route.bp) app.register_blueprint(site_route.bp) app.register_blueprint(user_route.bp) @app.after_request def after_request(response): origin = request.headers['Origin'] result = list( filter( lambda x: x in origin, ALLOWED_URLS ) ) if len(result) > 0: response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin) response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With') response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true') response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE') return response return app Solution source - CORS, AngularJS and Flask Depends on the request being a global object. Using a filter to see if the domain name is in the origin url. Gives some security and allow for domain level access. Means I will use ngrok to access remote site. Now to test the authentication part. Seems like a better solution than the CORS solution. Still not able to get the authorization to work on the API Gateway. Might have to resort to just checking it on the actual server side. To do tomorrow. Wednesday 20 June 2017 Another day of trying to get authorization to work. It works with Postman so it has nothing to do with the other issues. Need to figure out why it works with Postman but not with the actual application. Using Postman to troubleshoot application authorisation. ngrok start -config=./ngrok.yml --all alias ngrok-start=\"ngrok start -config=./ngrok.yml --all\" Bash Programming - Make into one liners. Really want aliases. Aliases in Bash Productivity with Bash Bash Productivity # alias-name='command to do thing' alias docker-refresh='docker-compose down && docker-compose up' alias serve-dir='python -m SimpleHTTPServer' Testing configuration with ngrok and Postman. Created test api that points back to local running api server via ngrok. Client server accessible via ngrok too. [x] Eliminate any issues with the API server [x] Issue with getting Origin header. Error is KeyError: 'HTTP_ORIGIN' [x] Try and send back the Origin header. Setup the header in the Request section. Then setup the response in the integration section. Might have to save and then try again if using the console. Does not seem to make any difference though. [x] Setting it in the Method Request. Does not work [x] Setting up and integration mapping - To get anything sent to the backend, Setup in both the method and the request integration section [x] API Gateway with authorization key works. Tested with Postman. Issue is now related to the code we are sending to the API Gateway. Troubleshooting the client [x] Removing the extra headers. Only leaving the Authorization header. [x] Removing the Content-Type header seems to want to submit the data as a form. [x] Putting the content-type header back. Removed my fancy function to create the header object with Object.assign({}). Header is headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json','Authorization': data.idToken.jwtToken} [x] Really slow because I'm dealing with a slow proxy connection from my local machine. [x] Added CORS to API gateway. Added explicit origin server. Also added X-Requested-With to Access-Control-Allow-Headers [x] It works It is all about the headers. CORS is a pain. Unfortunately, would have loved to use flask-cors but it would require me to learn that code before I could even use it. Documentation is great but it seems very specific. Headers we had to add Access-Control-Allow-Headers - X-Requested-With* Has to be very explicit with the Origin header. Need to return a specific header. Use OPTIONS in amazon to essentially notify the client with all the data it needs. List of Header Fields Authorization key works just fine when sent from Postman. Also fixed the issue with the HTTP_ORIGIN key issue. Now essentially catch an error and replace it with host. Assuming that is being controlled by Amazon not sending back all the headers. Could try and see if I can get the Origin header sent. AWS API Gateway Integration Pass-through-behavior Main lookfindme site. Trying to pull front data from database. Any changes made in admin section will appear in front section. Need to update everything first. It's been a few weeks since I've worked with that site. Think everything is being pulled from an outside config file anyway. Updating my environment. Reinstall psycopg2 with the notes about export export PIP_NO_BINARY=psycopg2 pipenv install psycopg2 Just found out that in medics, this creates the ability to copy the code that is inside. Nice! Updating all the code in lookfindme. Probably going to have to spend some time just cleaning everything up. Will then create an object with all the details from the settings. That's the main page. Also get the list of memberships and the list of industries. Sounds like I should save all of that stuff in a dynamodb field with the ability to just save new ones as the become available. Would then pull the data from the dynamodb field. Can setup dynamodb locally and see if I can get it to work. Who knows? My attempt at writing a decorator. Added new response headers to a response. Found an easier way to do it with @app.after_request and flask.request which is a global. Solved the CORS issue. def add_headers(response_function): @wraps(response_function) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): response = response_function(*args, **kwargs) response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = 'https://2a9cc487.eu.ngrok.io' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Authorization, Content-Type' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'] = 'true' response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With' def new_response_function(*args, **kwargs): return response return response return wrapper Got the basic endpoint for the public api created. Tests also created and they work. Now it is time to set it up on the actual client side. Going to use axios since it is already installed. Everything is getting really slow. Just trying to update the front page. It is taking forever. Redoing my css extract. Installing npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin Will need to reconfigure to get it to work with the current setup. Current setup is just jacked. Hopefully got everything working. We are about to find out. Installed vue-loader and vue-style-loader. Hope it works. Got the basic site to work. Have FAQ and About working on the site. Even the main image can be changed. Trying to fix the build issues. Got the site to upload. Now working. But images are not working. Will have to fix that. Updated the front page to talk to the main server. Need to add a button to clear image list. Running admin site and public site at the same time. Thursday 21 June 2018 Got the basic admin site connected to the public site. Just need to redo the formatting/design of the site. Also need to make the transitions better. Going to focus today on the KinderCare site. [ ] Setup security to backend server (certificate). Will have to configure certificate to only work on specific endpoints. [ ] Setup Cognito for username/password acces [ ] Will use the same Cognito for parent/guardian access in the future. [ ] Registration should include email/first/last/phone [ ] Site will be added based on which site you are registering from. [ ] Need a child's id number to validate you are eligible to register for the site. [ ] Create username/password screens. [ ] New password [ ] Reset password [ ] Verification code Did not really get anything done today. Did write an article for my blog that needs to be edited and updated. Should probably check the rest of the articles and check for errors. Need to update my blog to work correctly on a mobile phone or device. Fix the form to fill the whole space on a mobile device. It seems to be okay on the desktop browser. Have to get it to work on iPad browser. Was unable to configure NGINX correctly with a path of /wordpress. Luckily the API works connecting directly to the server. Now need to clean up the bottom form. Ok. Cleaned up the bottom part of my site. Uploading this version. Going to add extract text to it. Seems to be working really well. Uses style-loader during development. ExtractCss when actually building for deployment. Friday 22 June 2018 Getting side tracked looking into C# for this project I'm doing on Real Estate. Might as well gain from the experience. No reason to keep doing the same wheel. Today, need to refactor some of my writing. Also, need to work on my agency site. Need to figure out the services offered, examples of work, etc. Focus on web development, microsite and wordpress development. Emphasise the use of cloud based services for rapid development, security and scalability benefits. Don't talk about cost. Installing .NET SDK on machine. Trump is President and we are running Microsoft .NET on a Mac machine. Copying documentation over to my Mac. Might want to get out of the house a little later and take a good look at the database. Put together a schema for what needs to be done. [ ] Articles. Need to edit to make sure they don't sound stupid. [x] Edited one. [x] Fixed the image with the wrong image showing up on the article page. Had a period rather than a colon for the image. Punctuation matters!!!! [x] Redid the Flask/CORS article. Thinking about pushing it to Medium. May want to push it to LinkedIn too. [x] Remove the ones that are no longer relevant. [x] Fixed a couple of issues with my personal site. Hero image was not coming from a secure url. Button on my form was not showing up. Captcha seemed to have some issues. [x] Developer notebook now points to my domain. [x] Setup google analytics under martin.johan@catenare.com. Have too many accounts. [x] Added to Google Webmaster account using martin.johan@catenare.com. Using the meta tag verification link. Waiting for the build to complete so I can wait for the build to upload onto a server. [ ] Did learn about the additional services Google Analytics provide. [ ] API for surveys. Should be interesting integrating that into a project. [ ] Google Data reporting service. Like that you can connect to an external database. Don't know how safe I feel about a publicly accessible database. Wonder if you can do something with Excel. [ ] Waiting for site to upload. Need to do some work on the KinderCare website. Workon on the API Gateway configuration. Username/password setup Fix in the current lookfindme site. Can copy that to KinderCare site. Just need to take careful notes. Mkdocs feature - edit your documentation directly in Github. Great if you're not in front of your computer but need to update some documentation. Also, can copy and paste code if necessary into the github version. Back to working on lookfindme Visual Studio Code snippets - organise imports - command-shift-p then type organize imports Reorganized my devnotes documentation a little. Added the operations section related to Linux. Especially related to swap space and free memory. Upgrading the packages on the machine.

Analytics Setup and configure Google Analytics Custom reporting and dashboards. Custom tagging Excel integration Experience Development and marketing experience Web development Back onto the angular app. Have to context switch. Creating an Auth module to keep all the auth related stuff. Creating a custom module - Lazy Loading Modules Generate the module and components. ng generate module auth --routing ng generate component auth/auth -m auth - parent component. Everything will run through this. ng generate component auth/login -m auth ng generate component auth/logout -m auth --spec=false - Don't want the spec file ng generate component auth/reset -m auth --spec=false ng generate component auth/forgot -m auth --spec=false In app.routing.module add the child route { path: 'auth', loadChildren: 'app/auth/auth.module#AuthModule' }, Code in app/auth/auth-routing.module.ts import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router'; import { AuthComponent } from './auth/auth.component'; import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: AuthComponent }, { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class AuthRoutingModule { } Now have a submodule that will be in charge of Authentication. Will still have to share libraries and services across since I'll be using amplify for authorization. Cool, got that to work. Now going to convert what we currently have into it's own feature module. Let us cleanup our main app. For a future exercise. Create a new children layer and move all the children routing into that module. We can then have a blank page when we start up. Going ahead and creating a feature module called Welcome. We are going to stick the children module inside of it. Starting up, we should not have anything visible. If you are not logged in. You will get directed to the auth page. Got it to work. Key is children. Angular is smart enough to figure out you want to use the children when you're routing inside of a child component. Angular is making more sense now. Seems like it really is easier to manage multiple modules. Figuring out canActivate to guard against aunauthorized access. Can also fetch data before showing the actual route. A guard returns either true or false. Relative routes work too. Makes it easier to refactor routes in the future. When doing canActivate, be sure to include the AuthGuard service in the module you're trying to guard. StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[AuthGuard] So, basic canActivate service is working. Modules are addictive. Ended up creating settings and help modules in addition to the ones I already had. Now going to work on getting all of this stuff to actually work together. ng build --prod --aot for production builds. Saturday 23 June 2018 Focusing on the KinderCare admin site. Need to get the payments working so I can put it to rest. Doing the authentication today and hopefully working on the registration too. Just doing direct authentication and maybe password reset. Won't be able to register to the site. That's for the future front-end. Old school CSS and html only. Focus on making the site responsive with html and css. Then add the javascript. Going to work on the Nziswano - Put together at least the basic page. Of course there was an issue. CNAME being overwritten in mkdocs file. Resolution seems to be to create a CNAME file with your domain name in the docs directory. We will see if this works. Just checked my site with the google tool. Does not see the javascript based content. Will have to pre-render the page for Google to be able to index it. Just found some more tools that Google provides for businesses. Just spent an hour working on nothing that I'm supposed to. Nziswano site OpenGraph tools MetaTags SiteMaps - why do they matter? Google Webmaster tools - security and content check. Basic site outline in html. Trying to use foundation. Still a big fan because it is an html/css framework. Looking into using pure - Just need a basic css framework. Does not support flex It is time to get on that band wagon. KinderCare site Authentication Registration Cleaning up my notes with inactive links. Just used MetaTags to generate opengraph tags for my site. Seems like I have no choice to keep using Foundation for Sites. Seems to be only tool really dedicated to building static first web sites. There panini tool makes all of this so much easier. Still can't really find a good alternative to generating a static site with just html and css while also enjoying some of the benefits of having a backend templating engine. Setting up my nziswano site Installing panini gulp browser-sync Trying to create a static web site but haves scss and any typscript or javascript rendered by webpack. Have webpack do all the reloading. Kinda stupid. Should just install with foundation-cli has not been updated in forever Google Developer Tools Puppeteer - screenshots of your site. Can compare versions. installed gulp panini webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli installed foundation-sites installed npm install --save-dev autoprefixer cross-env gh-pages Added rimraf and gulp-babel, @babel-register Did not need all the extra babel stuff. Renamed gulp.babel.js to gulp.js . All the scss and js transformation will happen with webpack. Gulp is strictly for combining the html files and copying them over to the dist directory. Just need gulp@next rimraf clean the directory and panini for panini to work. Added node-sass , postcss-cssnext , postcss-scss . Also added npm-run-all because I need to run both gulp and webpack Also added \"babel-loader@^8.0.0-beta\" @babel/core @babel/preset-env - babel-preset-env Got the gulp part to work. Now to configure the webpack part. Installed css-loader sass-loader style-loader and postcss-loader . Want it to generate the correct css. Added postcss.config.js file to root directory. Read somewhere that the current postcss does not read the package.json file.

Also need to change what we are storing in the settings object. Don't think we need images anymore. Another question is, do we break things up into their own columns? Since we are saving the complete record every time, don't think we need to. Tabs look okay. Not going to win any awards for the layout or design.

Can't call a function before it is defined. So, CORS functionality actually takes the response from the request and returns the origin based on that request. Mmmm. Look into logging when I get back. How to resolve this CORS issue? Client is sending headers to the server which the server needs to respond to. It's and OPTION call which means we need to reply to that call. Don't know if the ajax observable is sending things I don't know about. Need to setup logging for Python so I can log what is happening. Fixing the issue [x] Setup logging for Python * Can at least tell which functions are being called. * Going with flask_cors. Still having issues. Can't seem to be able to save anything. Used to work via a proxy. [x] See what is being sent in the headers when the client connects to the server. Using curl -i -X OPTIONS [x] See what we are sending back. [x] Decorator is not working because I'm sending back a result rather than a function that produces a result. curl to find out if we are getting the right headers back. curl -i -X OPTIONS include header information Sending Post Data via curl curl --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --request POST \\ --data '{\"username\":\"xyz\",\"password\":\"xyz\"}' \\ http://localhost:3000/api/login * Shows what header information is being returned. * Need to get a generic setup to return for any option request. * Fixed an issue where the loader wasn't going away during an error.

Was fighting with the client and the backend server. Seems that everything is related to the FLASK/python application sending the correct headers back to the web client. Ended up using flask-cors. Seems like it already does all the dirty work I need to do. When one is doing functions, one has to keep that in mind. [x] Getting import roles to work [x] Get the all setup to work too. Issue I'm running into now. 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '*' . See if I can get ngrok to work. Who knows. On Amazon API Gateway. Enabled CORS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: true OPTIONS there too. On the client withCredentials: true Added Authorization Header Leaving crossDomain as false Creating a new API from scratch. I'm worried that the CORS stuff is all messed up. Hardest part is getting the domain redirected to the new domain name. Nothing is ever just straightforward. Think the issue I'm having right now is that the backend server is returning \"*\" in the content header. These headers are a mess. So, when you delete your API and you also deleted the custom domain, it seems that the only way to create a new one with the same domain name is to remove that domain from your dns and then recreate. Ok. Deleted the cname record from GoDaddy and was able to recreate the custom domain name. Now just have to wait for it to initialise. That takes forever. In the meantime, going to set the url to ngrok to see if we can get that to work. Might need to have some type of webhook to determine which origin header to use. Configuring flask-cors to only allow from a specific domain name. - Flask CORS Documentation - Might have to not use this anymore. Seems like I may have found a solution that works better. We will see. CORS(app, expose_headers='Authorization', origins=['*.lookfindme.com', '*.ngrok.io'], supports_credentials=True) Side note - added PIP_NO_BINARY=psycopg2 to .flaskenv file.

Will still have to share libraries and services across since I'll be using amplify for authorization. Cool, got that to work. Now going to convert what we currently have into it's own feature module. Let us cleanup our main app. For a future exercise. Create a new children layer and move all the children routing into that module. We can then have a blank page when we start up. Going ahead and creating a feature module called Welcome. We are going to stick the children module inside of it. Starting up, we should not have anything visible. If you are not logged in. You will get directed to the auth page. Got it to work. Key is children. Angular is smart enough to figure out you want to use the children when you're routing inside of a child component. Angular is making more sense now. Seems like it really is easier to manage multiple modules. Figuring out canActivate to guard against aunauthorized access. Can also fetch data before showing the actual route. A guard returns either true or false. Relative routes work too. Makes it easier to refactor routes in the future. When doing canActivate, be sure to include the AuthGuard service in the module you're trying to guard. StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[AuthGuard] So, basic canActivate service is working.

I'm currently working on a project where I'm using Amazon's CloudFront service to host the VueJS front end, Amazon's API gateway for communication between the front end and the back end, Amazon's Cognito identity service for authentication and Amazon's relational database service for PostgreSQL as our database. My personal site is built using WordPress as the back end and using React to on the front end to present my posts. The front end is hosted on Google Firebase. I'm also a registered developer on the Shopify platform and actually have a basic Shopify template that I created in my Github repository. My PHP experience includes Rent The Runway. I incorporated Symfony into the Drupal based stack because it was a general, MVC based framework that was just easier to build upon. Being object oriented and having ORM support made development a little bit more rationale. I also setup a Hudson server to do some automated testing of our stack using PHPUnit. At CNBC.com, I helped convert their Microsoft provided content management system to a PHP based \"headless\" content management system. The frontend used Zend Framework with Smarty templates and page configuration profiles for content presentation. The backend content management system was based on Drupal but we used Zend Framework to build out some of the infrastructure such as the automated content ingestion tools. Working with an offshore team at Experian, we built and maintained a CodeIgniter based frontend that enabled our clients' representatives to send marketing emails via our Cheetahmail email marketing platform. This gave them the ability to run individual campaigns and customize their messaging on an individual level. The application also provided analytical dashboards. Look forward to hearing from you.

Working on a team. Working on multiple projects and being able to understand the project when you come back to it. Keep CSS maintainable. Keep stylesheets scalable. Documentation for the next developer on the system. Easier to transfer to another developer. Not required to be a mind reader anymore. Code as comments have failed. CSS/SCSS Architecture & Styleguide Suggestions Modular - separation between components Legible - easy to read (think Python pep8) Clarity over succinctness - clear rather than clever. Flat - naming not too long Avoid conflicts - namespacing for components to avoid conflicts Naming convention .cn-{company-name} - global company name space. Company name not necessary if specific company .c- - component .ui - component css .c-ui-slider .l- - layout item - .l-grid-6 .is- or .has- - state of the item .js- - JavaScript targeting. No style associated. Used for JS targeting (click, etc.) BEM Block - Element - Modifier .cn-c-card__title - Block is .cn-c-card and Element is __title .cn-c-alert--error - Block .cn-c-alert and modifier --error Organization Base styles Rules for bare elements. Like normalizer. Keep it minimal Objects Focus on structure and layout. No decorative styles. Components Discrete, self-contained units of UI. Button or a carousel. Needs to be self contained.
