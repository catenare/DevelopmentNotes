# Developer Notebook for [Johan Martin](mailto:martin.johan@johan-martin.com)
## Notes are online at [Johan Martin's Development Notes](http://www.catenare.com/devnotes/)
* Easier to write things down then trying to remember what you forgot.
* Working on web development projects is changing rapidly and constantly.
* Resources are available everywhere but some are outdated and only some help with solving your problem.
* Easier to review notes on how you solved it last time than googling and going through all the articles again.
* Too much Googling can lead to a waste of time.
* Track your development
## Tech
* Notes are written in Markdown
	* Using [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) and Microsoft Visual Studio Code to edit the docs.
* Site generated with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
	* Deciding factor was the ability to push docs to *gh-pages* on Github.
	* Essentially free hosting for my document notebook.
* Notes for setting up notebook in notebook.

## Updates
