# Linux System Administration

## Notes
* Creating a swap drive [Swap on LightSail](/ops/amazon/#issues-with-deployment-on-lightsail)
* Seems that even with an SSD, swap needs to be turned on so it can actually be used. Everytime the server restarts, it needs to be reset.
* Checking memory usage [Linux Memory Usage commands](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-command-check-memory-usage)
    * `free`
    * `vmstat`
    * `htop`
