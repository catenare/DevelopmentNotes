## Monday 2 July 2018
We start a new week. It is freezing in South Africa. Need to work on getting money this week. Options are freelancing sites.
Will work on my agency site today. Give me a chance to flesh out my resume too.

    * Upgrade foundation-sites - `npm install foundation-sites@6.5.0-rc.1`
    * Easier than trying to build the actual full site. Too much work.
    * Combine webpack with gulp - [Combine Webpack with gulp](https://css-tricks.com/combine-webpack-gulp-4/)

    * Done playing with webpack and gulp. Need to work on the nziswano web site.

* Talking about race in South Africa is a convenient excuse for the current administration not to admit that they failed the majority of the people. Race and the land issue are smoke screens for real problems. Real issue is the inequality. No once cares about race when money is involved. Richest people in the world are not white.
* Have the basics of my content put together. Ready to create a layout for my site now.
