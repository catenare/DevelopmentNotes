# Deciding on a framework for mobile development

## Goals
* Rapid development.
    * Trying to get a quick prototype up and running to test out the feasability of the project
* Web initially
    * Create the equivalent of a mobile web site that can be packaged as a native app later. Can be a combination of both web and native.
* IOS first
    * Focused on developing an IOS app. Will port to Android. Maybe to Windows based on the framework.
* Web framework
    * Use JavaScript, CSS, HTML for putting together project.

## Tools
* Apache Cordova - underlying tool for the hybrid platform.
* AngularJS - JavaScript framework that seems to be most portable to NativeScript. 
* TypeScript - write JavaScript with enterprise tools.

## Frameworks
* Ionic - Angular and typescript. Has an infrastructure around it. Can generate components with command line. 
* Framework7 - Seems to have a variety of templates.
* OnsenUI - just not enough for me to bite.

## Thinking
* Starting with Framework7 template tool. See how far we can get. Goal is to create a web site that will suffice as a prototype for mobile site.
