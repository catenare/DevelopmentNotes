# Welcome to Johan's Development Notes
Things I discover in my work as a developer. Resources and notes that I tend to forget. Beyond a paper notebook, this is the repository of things I find out while working on my projects. In the least, it will keep me from having to rediscover "the wheel" when working on future projects.
