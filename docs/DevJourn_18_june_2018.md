# Developer Journal Week of 18 June 2018
Goal this week is to at least finish the admin part of *lookfindme*. So close but for the details.

## Monday, 18 June 2018
Still working on lookfindme admin site. Having issues with the industries list. Not updating if there is only one item in the json array. Don't know why that it is. It will save okay but it seems to have an issue updating. Will check the interwebs else might just convert it to an array or a string with pipe characters and store it as a string. The data is actually being sent. The issue is the it is not being saved.
### lookfindme
* Look into why the industries list of positions doesn't want to update if there is only 1 item in the list.
