## KinderCare dev notes.
### Reporting using Birt
* When using a string as a default parameter, make sure to put quotes around it.
* If changing the column names of a view, recreate the dataset and reset bindings for the data set.
* If the view gets "stuck", use public.{view_name}. Got it to update at least.
