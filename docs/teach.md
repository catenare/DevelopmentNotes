# Teaching web development
## Teaching Tools
### [Eclipse Che](http://www.eclipse.org/che/)
* Provide all students with a running learner environment.
* Allow them to develop without the need for a regular machine.
* In a place like South Africa, all they will need is a basic terminal or laptop.
* Everyone who wants to learn web development should have a computer/laptop available.
* Will use the browser as the tool of choice for learning development.
* Setting up with docker toolbox on Mac OS X
    * be sure to run ```eval "$(docker-machine env default)"```
    * docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /Users/johan/Projects/eclispseChe/data:/data eclipse/che start
    * Got it to work on docker toolbox
