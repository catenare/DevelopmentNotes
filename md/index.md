# Welcome to Johan's Development Notes
This is just documentation of notes that I make as I work on different projects. Helps me remember what I did before yet also provides me with a repository of information for future projects.
Hopefully this will be helpful beyond just me.

## Project setup
* Virtualenvwrapper name: devnotes
* Published on github using gh-pages
