# Creating Project Documentation
## Using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
* Uses markdown.
* Works with github pages.
* Every project will have their own documentation
    * Styleguide should be included (frontend)
    * Project goals and requirements
    * Notes about development
    * Setup/install instructions
    * Resolution to issues (ongoing FAQ for the projects)
* Documentation pages stay in gh-pages branch.
* added ```pymdownx.tilde``` extension to get strikethrough to work.
* Using ```mkdocs gh-deploy``` to upload docs.
